Hello World,

this document's only purpose is to test Gustav's functionality in a production environment.

Gustav is a static-site generator written in PHP that provides a lot of useful and powerful features. It's open source and available for free on [GitHub](https://github.com/futape/gustav).  
An often not much recognized feature is a projects's documentation. Gustav offers a great and very detailed documentation. After reading the [*Getting Started*](https://github.com/futape/gustav/wiki/Getting-started) you should be good to go to run Gustav on your own webspace or server.  
This website's source is [publically available](https://github.com/futape/gustav.futape.de), too. Feel free to fork the repository and discover how to use Gustav's massive [PHP API](https://github.com/futape/gustav/wiki/API) to achieve a feature-rich result with just a few lines of code.

That's all for now.  
Cheers!
