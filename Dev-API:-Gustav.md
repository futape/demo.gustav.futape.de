##Static functions

###`public void initGustav()`

Initializes some of the Gustav class's static properties.  
For example, this function reads the configuration file and decodes it as JSON and saves the decoded array to a class-variable. Moreover it validates the configurations and resets invalid options to their default values. If no default value is available for an invalid option, a fatal Gustav-error may be raised. Otherwise a warning log entry is done for every invalid option.  
Furthermore this function checks whether all required files and directories exist and logs on inexistence.  
If the [`check_status`](Gustav-configuration#bool-check_status--true) configuration option is set to `false`, nothing is logged.
This function gets executed everytime `Gustav.php` is included and can be executed for just one time.
