To me, there doesn't seem to be a big need for extending Gustav's functionality. However, some interfaces and hooks are provided though.  
Internal functions of the Gustav classes are available via the correstonding Hooks classes.  
Moreover, Gustav provides a directory named `ext` that is located in the same directory the Gustav classes files are located in. If the filesystem and additional files or directories are used as an interface, these files are placed in this directory or in one of its subdirectories.
