The [source content](Source-content) is read by getting the content of the [source file](Source-files) and stripping away the [GvBlock definition](GvBlock-definition). Only the first linebreak following the [GvBlock](GvBlock) is removed. Any linebreaks following on that remain.  
If the source file is a [PHP source file](PHP-source-files), the file is executed as a PHP script and the printed text is used as source content.
