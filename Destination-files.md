Destination files are the generated output of a static-site generator like Gustav. They are build upon the [source contents](Source-content) and [template files](Template-files).  
Destination files are located in the destination directory if not specified differently by the [`_dest` GvBlock option](Gustav-core-options#_dest) and always have a file-extension of `html` or `php`.  
For more information see [*Generating destination files*](Generating-destination-files).
