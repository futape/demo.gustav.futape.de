Destination files are the generated output of a static-site generator like Gustav. They are build upon the source contents and template files.  
Destination files are located in the destination directory if not specified differently by the `_dest` GvBlock option and always have a file-extension of `html` or `php`.  
For more information see *Generating destination files*.
